Personnal ToDo for writing my PhD.

1. Brainstorm on different potential topics.
2. Order topics according to what is most required and link them with clear contributions.
3. Start writing a minimalistic thesis of parts I'm certain that should be included.
4. Build up a list of most required experiments supporting the contributions.
5. Go over the core and iteratively fill in gaps of research questions.
